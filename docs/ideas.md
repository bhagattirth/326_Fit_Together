Innovative Idea:
Our idea relates to the application “Tinder” (hence the name), however instead of matching with individuals looking for a relationship, you match with individuals who are looking for workout partners. This relates to “Tinder” as you will be suggested partners with similar workout splits and times and you can either choose to match or not to match. In this, all matches will be similar to “Super-Liking” from Tinder in that it will notify the person you match with of your interest. From there, they can also accept or not. If you accept, you will be able to get their contact information provided when creating their account. After a workout with a partner, you can rate them (which isn’t shown, but kept internally for protection of individuals in case someone gets too many bad ratings and must be reviewed).

Important Components:
One component of our final project is our gym buddy preview. This will consist of an image storing functionality which stores images associated with each account so that you will be able to see what your potential gym buddies look like. This will require storing image data.
Another component of our final project is our match system. This will allow for Person A to match with Person B, and Person B to be notified. Then, Person B will either accept or reject the match. Once matched, it will be stored as a match in the database. This will require storing all half and complete match data. After a complete match, the contact information provided during sign up will be exchanged.
A third component of our final project is our rating system. This will allow for individuals who have matched with another person to rate them after a complete match. This data will not be available to the public, but will be stored for safety reasons. If an individual gets too many bad reviews, they will be banned from the platform for being a bad workout partner. This will require storing review data pertaining to each individual.
A fourth component of our final project will be the availability section. This will allow individuals to select their availability and change it as needed. This will ensure that you are attempting to find workout partners that are available at the same times and dates as you. This requires storing date and time information for each individual and sorting it based on overlapping times to provide the matching functionality.
