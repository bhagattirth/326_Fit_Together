## Data Interaction

Our plan for data interaction is the same as last time. *One component of our final project is our gym buddy preview. This will consist of an image storing functionality which stores images associated with each account so that you will be able to see what your potential gym buddies look like. This will require storing image data. Another component of our final project is our match system. This will allow for Person A to match with Person B, and Person B to be notified. Then, Person B will either accept or reject the match. Once matched, it will be stored as a match in the database. This will require storing all half and complete match data. After a complete match, the contact information provided during sign up will be exchanged. A third component of our final project is our rating system. This will allow for individuals who have matched with another person to rate them after a complete match. This data will not be available to the public, but will be stored for safety reasons. If an individual gets too many bad reviews, they will be banned from the platform for being a bad workout partner. This will require storing review data pertaining to each individual. A fourth component of our final project will be the availability section. This will allow individuals to select their availability and change it as needed. This will ensure that you are attempting to find workout partners that are available at the same times and dates as you. This requires storing date and time information for each individual and sorting it based on overlapping times to provide the matching functionality.*


## Wireframe + Website Images
### Login
***
Allows users to login and access the full site. However, if the user doesn't have an account, they can make one on this page.

## Home Page
***
This is the first page people see when they get to the site. The page offers information about the service and allows people to head to the login/signup page to access the entire site. If the user is already logged in, they can hit the profile button, allowing them to modify their profile or get match to a “gym buddy.”

## Profile
***
Allows the user to input his workout schedule and preference, so the algorithm can find the best fit for the user.

## Matching Page
***
This page allows members to find “gym buddies” that they want to work out with. The page tries to match the user to match their preference, and when it finds the best fit, you are able to see the other participant’s profile. Then, you have the choice of working out with them (by clicking the check mark) or finding a different one (by using the “x” button).

## Matching History
***
Allows the user to view whom they workout out with in the past. They can either search for a particular member or scroll through different pages to find one. And for each member, the user is able to report, rate, and catalog past workouts. And they are able to request to work out with the same member again.

## Division of Labor

In our group, labor was split evenly amoung ourselves. Mark handled making two of the webpages and most of the css (Index.html, matchingPage.html, and stlyesheet.css). Kenneth was responsible for making Profile.html, half of matchingHistory.html and being one major of the contributing to the wireframe. Tirth was responsible for doing the other half of matchingHistory.html, login.html, wireframe, and doing milestone1.md (with the help of Kenneth).
