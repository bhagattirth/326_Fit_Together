## Data Interaction

Our plan for data interaction is the same as last time. TODO


## Wireframe + Website Images
### Login
***



UFIT’s Login Page

## Home Page
***
This is the first page people see when they get to the site. The page offers information about the service and allows people to head to the login/signup page to access the entire site. If the user is already logged in, they can hit the profile button, allowing them to modify their profile or get match to a “gym buddy.”

## Profile
***
Allows the user to input his workout schedule and preference, so the algorithm can find the best fit for the user. 


## Matching Page
***
This page allows members to find “gym buddies” that they want to work out with. The page tries to match the user to match their preference, and when it finds the best fit, you are able to see the other participant’s profile. Then, you have the choice of working out with them (by clicking the check mark) or finding a different one (by using the “x” button).

## Matching History
***
Allows the user to view whom they workout out with in the past. They can either search for a particular member or scroll through different pages to find one. And for each member, the user is able to report, rate, and catalog past workouts. And they are able to request to work out with the same member again.
